Todo:

Exploit:
- It is possible to spam the pathcache table from outside: If you call a page id with &no_cache=1 and incrementing &L, pages will be generated with the &L variable in the links and the pathcache table is filled with bogus entries.
- Same with the error-log, easily spammed by calling wrong URLs. Problem? Not any different from a webserver log anyway...
- The same with decodeCache, eg "http://typo3.org/community/mailing-lists/1301.0.html", "http://typo3.org/community/mailing-lists/1301.1.html", etc.
- encodeCache as well? Possible solution: To check L against sys_language table. Or for encode cache, only use it when &no_cache is not used. (or totally disable &no_cache parameter!)
