2006-03-26 - Robert Lemke <robert@typo3.org>
- tx_templavoila_mod1_localization: Removed sidebar_renderItem_renderTranslationInfoCheckbox()
~ mod1/index.php: Changed GET parameter "localizeRecord" to "localizeElement"
~ Various cosmetic code changes
# tx_templavoila_api: Fixed a bug in the processing for localizing elements under the "free" translation paradigm.
~ Changed the new TSconfig option introduced in the last commit from "(boolean) mod.web_txtemplavoilaM1.freeParadigm=0|1" to "(string)mod.web_txtemplavoilaM1.translationParadigm=free|bound". Please add proper documentation to the manual.
!!! Depending on how you use localization, administrators might need to enable the old style translation paradigm by adding "mod.web_txtemplavoilaM1.translationParadigm=free" to your TSconfig configuration.

2006-03-16 - Kasper Skaarhoej
	* Patched in the combined efforts of Bernhard and me over this week to accomodate various localization paradigms. Still missing finetuning and documentation of a few parts.

2006-03-23 - Robert Lemke <robert@typo3.org>
# Fixed a bug in class.tx_templavoila_tcemain.php (line 156): $row['uid'] never contained a value, use $elementArr['uid'] instead

2006-03-16 - Kasper Skaarhoej

	# Fixed bug in mod2: empty pid was passed to alt_doc when new root TO is created for static DS

2006-03-17 Robert Lemke <robert@typo3.org>
~ a few cosmetic changes in class.tx_templavoila_mod1_localization.php
+ added a few placeholders for context sensitive help
+ updated german LLXML translations for all labels

2006-03-16 - Kasper Skaarhoej
	* Inserted version selector from typo3/template.php instead of homebrewn (which is commented out, can be removed when consolidated)
	* Shows non-used elements only if workspace is "Live"
	* Fixed all known workspace related problems. This was mainly:
	* "Page" type versions: All elements appears as if they were references from another page. That is fixed.
	* Copy/Paste/Reference/Unlink/Insert of elements under workspaces in various scenarios are working now (except copying an Container Element FCE recursively: References does not get fixed, but this is a tcemain problem that must be solved on that level!!)
	* Details about the work:
		* wsMapId(): I removed almost all usages of wsMapId(); They were used to map uids of elements to be copied for instance. This is wrong. The uid of an element you want to copy or delete (basically any tcemain &cmd operation) must be the _live_ uid, not the offline uid. [Currently copying in tcemain when in a workspcae does not work correctly but that must be fixed on core level, not in TV]
		* tx_templavoila_api::flexform_getValidPointer(): This function would re-map the UID value in the pointer if found. This lead to many errors. As a basic principles: _All_ uids passed around must be the "live" uids of elements, _never_ the offline uids. Only when explicitly needed should a uid be mapped to the offline version. Another problem was PID values: They were sometimes "-1" due to usage of "offline" uids which lead to weird errors when a copy was made of objects to pid = "-1" (using pid of a record with uid "1" in tcemain!!!).
			* Summary: In tx_templavoila_api, always use uids/pids of live elements. For getting workspace record content you can safely use (and probably should) t3lib_BEfunc::getRecordWSOL() which will protect the live uid/pid while all other values change, including the "tx_templavoila_flex" which is VERY IMPORTANT to get the workspace value from since that contains the correct list of elements in a field.
	* Testing combinations for Page module under workspaces:
		* Destination pointer: Test Inserting new/copies/cuts/references:
			 * Insert in both pages and tt_content element containers plus both in live and element versioned containers (4 combinations)
			 * Insert copies/cuts/references in other pages
		* Source: Try both live and element versioned elements for all of above.
		* Try Changing data structure of CEs and pages



2006-03-15 Robert Lemke <robert@typo3.org>
+ added test for checking the sorting field after an insertElement operation
# fixed a bug in tx_templavoila_api::insertElement_createRecord() which didn't respect the insert position for new elements when calling TCEmain
+ added test for moving elements up via TCEmain

2006-03-15 - Kasper Skaarhoej
+ Improved the cleaning-link with a button to clean-all on one page in one click, a true killer feature ;-) Robert might like to suggest to extract processing from presentation, but I would like to know how that is done best.

2006-03-14 very late - Kasper Skaarhoej
+ Added a Clean-FlexForm XML status and link to the outline view.

2006-03-13 a little later - Kasper Skaarhoej
+ Added new view: "Outline". This will show a tree view of the page content structure. This view is currently only available for Admin users and they toggle it using a new checkbox in the "Advanced" tab. All affected functions are in mod1/index.php in its own section and will be easy to move to another class if needed. However, they are a parallel implementation of the render_framework* functions.
# Fixed bug I made during refactoring: Names of columns was not displayed

2006-03-13  Kasper Skaarhoej
~ Re-inserted rejected changes, however I fixed all problems pointed out by robert in mail.
~ Moved getContentTree from mod1/index.php to api-class: At the same time the output from getContentTree has been cleaned up so it doesn't contain formatted preview output (only data on which a preview can be rendered in mod1/index.php).
getContentTree also includes elements from all languages in its structure (although mod1/index.php only shows the selected language); this leads to the sideeffect that the list of non-used content elements is accurate now!
getContentTree can be used from other applications to read out the page structure from TemplaVoila!
The refactoring of getContentTree() has been thoroughly tested with as many scenarios I could create and I'm very confident it will work.
Of course, all parameters of getContentTree-related functions may have been moved around since the functions were moved; It is considered unrealistic that any external extension were using getContentTree from its location in mod1/index.php.
~ Changed that the sidebar is now _outside_ (on top of) the rendered page: This was necessary to have proper function in case (very rarely though) that sheets are used for the page template! Question is if we should take some action to move only the icons for the top-level element to top of page again?

2006-03-13	Robert Lemke <robert@typo3.org>
- mod1_localization: Language selector ($availableTranslationFlags) - Rejected the changes and used an older version which already ignores the "langDisable" tag for the root element. Reason for rejecting the new code is that the strings are not localized with getLL
~ mod1/index.php: Changed case of magic strings "Disable", "Inheritence" and "Separate" to lower case
- mod1/index.php: Rejected localization mode warning because it's not translated with getLL, please commit again with locallang label
- mod1/index.php: Rejected edit translation link because of missing locallang support

2006-03-13  Kasper Skaarhoej
~ When a parent container element has localization set to "Separate", the links to localization of contained records are removed. This is done in mod1/index.php, line 843 [($parentDsMeta['langDisable'] || $parentDsMeta['langChildren'])]. Maybe it should be configurable?
~ Also updated the JavaDoc of mod1/index.php and function overview in top of document.

2006-03-10  Kasper Skaarhoej
- Removed the checkbox, sidebar_renderItem_renderTranslationInfoCheckbox(), from localization sidebar: Not needed, set by default
+ Changed "Default language" icon to a new one, "flags/unknown.gif"
~ Links to editing of page language header are displayed regardless of selected language (why not?)
~ The links to editing of page language header are separated from the selection of language. More userfriendly and practical
# Mistakenly, the selection of language/editing of page language header was not shown if the data structure had localization mode "Disabled". The data structure localization mode has no influence on whether the page is localized or not. Therefore, the setting ->rootElementLanguageDisable has also been removed (and substituted with "rootElementLanguageMode").
~ In TemplaVoilas tcemain hooks a reference was mistakenly created when a tcemain command (like copy or new version) created a new element. I disabled reference creation upon any command now since I can't see when you would like one. In addition I would like to raise doubt how safe it is to assume that any creation of a record in tcemain is supposed to generate a relation in TemplaVoilas context. I ask that such a hook is very conservative and only sets the reference if absolutely sure. I can't tell if there are problems but ask that Robert consider it.
+ Added a new internal flag for the page module: "->translatorMode". The idea is that when this flag is set all buttons, context menus and editing links are removed EXCEPT links that links to editing of localizable elements or localizes an element. This mode is automatically set for a user if they have no access to the default language (thus assumed to be a translator of one or more languages). This action scales down the modules complexity and for translators - typically foreign to TYPO3 - it will be much easier to translate, simply by the approach "Click-the-flag" (generally, all icons for languages can be clicked to edit the language)
~ Brought back the warning if a container element is "Inheritance" or "Separate" modes. I know this will seem odd to those who uses those modes, but as my localization guide describes, these modes should only be used under special circumstances. Using Page TSconfig they can be disabled (this is already documented in the manual.sxw). However, the Web > TemplaVoila module will still show warnings in the detail view if those localization modes are found for data structures with container fields
~ Re-introduced Roberts old links to localization, but commented out in the code. Just for debugging/discussion/testing...
~ The message "Localized flexform" is now linked to editing of the record (for translators) - AND the message is only shown when relevant, that is when there actually are content to translate. It means for all container elements with not actual content carrying fields they will not be shown.
~ Modified a few keys in the tree structure that the module makes, in particular the 'fields' key. This doesn't seem to be used actively anywhere in TemplaVoila so I assume it is safe to do. (or irrelevant, pick your favourite :-)
~ I re-introduced the "mod.SHARED.defaultLanguageLabel" and "mod.SHARED.defaultLanguageFlag". Robert had converted those to "defaultLanguage.title" and "-.flag" but since "mod.SHARED.defaultLanguageLabel" is already used in Web>Page and Web>List for long time it is wrong to correct this now. Hence they are reintroduced and the old ones not supported anymore. Documentation didn't even document them (another reason to change it).

# Fixed a fatal error in mod2 in DSdetails() when $DScontent was not an array


2006-02-23	Robert Lemke <robert@typo3.org>

@Dmitry: Each time you commit something, my CVS client displays *all* files as changed and show 100% conflict. Please make sure that you upload only those files which have changed (or help me using CVS correctly ...)

+ added new references / migration wizard to the Web -> Functions module. Works fine but needs some cleanup and locallang support
+ added new TSconfig option mod.web_txtemplavoilaM1.sideBarEnable which makes it possible to disable the toolbar (sidebar) for users, usergroups or page tree branches
~ Changed scope of TypoScript in Data Structures (tx_templavoila_pi1): Now not only lib. and plugin. is accessible from data structure-TypoScript, but also all other objects, except numerical 1st level objects.
- Removed the "uid" column in the list of unused elements because it exploded the sidebar when in "left" mode. You can still see the uid of an element if you move the mouse over the element icon
~ Updated manual

# Changing thumbnail code again due to the bug in typo3 core

2006-02-12	Dmitry Dulepov	<typo3@accio.lv>

# Fix: page module (mod1) did not show image thumbnails because of wrong back path
# Fix: clear cache was unavailable for current page

2006-02-07	Robert Lemke	<robert@typo3.org>

~ Merge of my changes and the previous commits of Dmitry and Kasper
+ A few new unit tests
# Fixed a bug which incorrectly referenced elements when moving them from one field of a parent FCE to another. Added unit test for this.

2006-01-28	Dmitry Dulepov	<typo3@accio.lv>

~ Code cleanup after analysis in Zend Studio

2006-01-25	Kasper Skaarhoej  <kasperYYYY@typo3.com>

+ Linked TemplaVoila into the extdeveval tool with a new class; This is going to be a tool which can convert FlexForm data from "separate" (langChildren = 0) to "inheritance" (langChildren = 1) localization types (the words I have used). Nicolas Cerisier from Dassault is expected to finish the code which I started out. New file added.
~ Added "Undefined" as Data Structure type (again). This will be used if TemplaVOila is used for templating where not related to pages or content elements.
+ Added reference counts for the "Not used elements" including a delete-button. It is now easy to clean up unused elements on a page. The criteria is that content elements which are not used in the hierarchy of a page and which have no references pointing to it can safely be deleted.
# Fixed a bug where old variable name $language should have been $languageArr. This affected the "Localization" tab content.
# Fixed a few bugs related to workspaces and how ids are handled. One misconception is that the input id (&id) should be translated to workspace version. Rather it should remain the real online id and only be translated when required. At this point it has introduced a bug for "page type" versions of pages but I will fix that later. The main type (element versions) works.
~ Reintroduced the element coloring according to versioning status in workspace.
# Fixed what I perceived as a bug for localization! here we should find out why our perceptions were different. I have only changed the _link_ to the localization action to call tcemain instead of changing your tv-api function (which is what I didn't understand the meaning of...)

2006-01-23	Dmitry Dulepov	<typo3@accio.lv>

+ mod2: added text before the table with template listing
# mod2: changed "not a directory" message in the wizard to be "more English"
# Fix: mod2: label about wrong directory
# Fix: mod2: uninitialized variable $fileref_mtime in renderTODisplay function (changed to $fileMtime)
# Fix: mod2: wrong TSConfig name for createPageWizard entry

2006-01-22	Dmitry Dulepov	<typo3@accio.lv>

# mod1: Updated orig_hash and fixed spelling errors in Latvian and Russian languages
# Fixed bug #2344: query does not work with postgresql

2006-01-20	Dmitry Dulepov	<typo3@accio.lv>

+ Fix (sidebar): if cache commands are not enabled for non-admin user, label for page cache is displayed with empty cell after it
+ Fix (ext_emconf.php): naming error message in extension manager for pages and tt_content
# Fixed bug #2085: Inconsistency in editing translations
# Fixed bug #2095: Problems with page copying
# Fixed bug #2206: copying elements doubles the references
# Fixed bug #2209: Gremlin: hide "Translations" Tab if no alternative Syslanguage are present
# Fixed bug #2236: TYPO3SEARCH_xxx should not be generated for FCE
# Fixed bug #2343: Page module creates many translations to the same language

2006-01-19	Dmitry Dulepov	<typo3@accio.lv>

# class.tx_templavoila_api.php: remove reference operator in a call to flexform_getFlexformPointersToSubElementsRecursively in function flexform_getPointersByRecord because it is deprecated and gives warnings in PHP 4+

# Fixed bug #2227: Pass-by-reference warning
# Fixed bug #2235: "print" version always appears in default language
# Fixed bug #2312: mod1: Language flag is missing for default language

2005-12-15	Robert Lemke	<robert@typo3.org>

~ !!! Did a major refactoring of the xmlrelhndl class! This class is now deprecated and not used within TemplaVoila anymore. Use tx_templavoila_api instead. With the new API only table "tt_content" is allowed for elements - in fact that was almost the case in the past but it might break your specific use of TV!
~ Raised dependencies to TYPO3 > 3.9.0
~ Did a major refactoring of the page module (mod1/index.php). Some functions are now located in other classes.
~ Moved the localization part of the sidebar into its own class
~ Converted all locallang files to the XML format
~ New Page Template Data Structures will have langDisable = 0 by default

+ Created a new class "tx_templavoila_api". This class provides a new API for other extensions and core hooks. It is fully unit tested and replaces tx_templavoila_xmlrelhndl
+ Added new features into tx_templavoila_tcemain: The sorting field is now automatically updated so it reflects the TV flexform order. It is now possible to move and create records with standard TCEmain requests (eg. with the List module or the classic Page Module!)
+ Added integration into the standard TYPO3 clipboard. You can now cut, edit, paste records from the list module to the TV page module and vice versa. This should work everywhere, where the clipboard is available
+ Added support for workspaces to new content element wizard.
+ Added a new Tag for the field section in a data structure: <oldStyleColumnNumber> allows you to connect a field to a column position number so the list module (and others) can guess where to reference new content elements in your page template. (See manual)
+ Added full support for workspaces internally - but some parts of the UI are not workspaces aware yet. Included several unit tests to make sure workspaces support works.
+ Created a new class for rendering the different doktype screens (for sysfolder, mount points etc.)
+ Added new EType "RTE" as a preset in the mapping tool

- Removed configuration for disabling the Template Selector because the TCA  are neccessary for FE editing and depended on that configuration
- !!! Removed support for rules from the page module. Evaluation of rules never really worked and - if needed - have to me implemented again, but differently.
- !!! Removed support for creating default elements. Based on rules engine (see above)
- !!! Removed hook "renderFrameWork_preProcessOutput" in the page module because too many things have changed in the rendering process.
- Removed TSconfig option "enableCElocalizationInfo". The localization information can now be switched on and off by a checkbox in the localization tab of the sidebar.
- Removed pi2 - data sources won't be implemented in TemplaVoila, an extension "datasources" exists for that purpose.
- Removed mod3 - Element references will be handled by TYPO3 4.0 core functions

# Fixed a number of bugs by creating the new API
# Fixed localization handling
# Fixed issue #0000802: Copy / paste nested structures from one language to another does not work like expected
# Fixed issue #0000917: Adding content using the create new CE wizard in the page tree has strange behaviour
# Fixed issue #0001087: Fatal Error open storage folder
# Fixed issue #0001334: It's not possible to preset tt_content fields in User TSConfig when using TemplaVoila. (Also related to creating pages and content elements with TemplaVoila in general)
+ Fixed issue #0001498: Missing "Edit translation header icon/button"
+ Fixed issue #0000714: Usability issue with content elements (Template Object selector)
+ Fixed issue #0001483: FCE preview in page module does not display sections/containers - Now basic support for displaying SC/CO is implemented
+ Fixed issue #0001858: Clear cache button is not available in TemplaVoila page module - A cache menu is now located in the "Advanced functions" tab
# Fixed issue #0000499: hide content element wizard when only fc-elements are in use / hide category headings in "Create new content element" wizard
+ Fixed issue #0001499: Show content from this page instead does not work. Also added support for many other doktypes
# Fixed issue #0001950: remove items from content wizzard which are not allowed for the current user
+ Fixed issue #0001760: Hide content elements when they are not mapped in the TO from the Page module

~ Updated manual

2005-11-04	Robert Lemke	<robert@typo3.org>

# Added some hints to the manual

# Fixed issue #0000087: cannot map to elements with ids that contain spaces

+ Added staging support for workspaces (t3ver_stage)

2005-10-04  Kasper Skaarhoej  <kasper2005@typo3.com>

 * Added support for versioning plus did some other changes to localization.

2005-04-27  Kasper Skaarhoej  <kasper@typo3.com>

 * Added that a warning is displayed if Flexible content container elements have localization enabled in a "dangerous" non-supported way. Warning can be disabled with Page TSconfig
 * Added that if an element on the local page is used more than one time inside the page structure it will be noticed in the display (assumption: Local content elements are normally shown only once on the page). (This changed helped to avoid some user confusion about copies and references)
 * Added context menu item "View: DS/TO" which will display the data structure display (and also tell the DS/TO uids)
 * Using t3lib_div::fixed_lgd_cs() for cropping strings (supporting backend charset)
 * Fixed a few bugs


2005-02-21 Robert Lemke <robert@typo3.org>
+ htmlmarkup: Added support and icon for DL, DD and DT HTML tags in the click menu (mapping tool). Solved feature request #0000671

2005-02-16  Kasper Skaarhoej  <kasper@typo3.com>

 * Added feature that allows a Template Object to point to another parent template object from which the print and language subtemplates will be taken if the actual template object doesn't have any defined it self. The feature is called "Inherit subtemplates from as defaults"

2005-02-08	Robert Lemke <robert@typo3.org>
# xmlrelhndl: Fixed a newly introduced bug which caused a parse error in PHP4 (but not in PHP5) ...
# ext_emconf.php: PHPEclipse did a line wrap were it shouldn't - fixed that.

2005-02-07	Robert Lemke <robert@typo3.org>
# xmlrelhndl: Fixed the bug mentioned before: Now FCEs are correctly copied recursively with correct referencing, files, pictures etc.

2005-01-27  Robert Lemke <robert@typo3.org>
~ Classic page module is now switched off by default, page template selector switched on (in the extension manager configuration dialogue)
+ mod1: Added support for making true copies of FCEs with sub elements. Before only the FCE parent element was truely copied, the child objects weren't. Still has a small bug, will fix that soon!

2005-01-21  Kasper Skaarhoej  <kasper@typo3.com>

 * Added a "Start new website" wizard which will set up TemplaVoila site basics in one minute. Found in the Web > TemplaVoila module.
 * MAY have fixed a bug where the mapping was mysteriously lost - but I might also have introduced a new bug instead. Please let me know!

2004-12-13  Kasper Skaarhoej  <kasper@typo3.com>

 * Added an EXAMPLE of how page-templates can come from a t3d file. I expect it needs some configuration of which folder to look for templates in, but the principles are shown. It will require the new TYPO3 source with modified import/export features.
 * Fixed a PHP5 bug with arrays...

2004-10-30  Robert Lemke  <robert@typo3.org>
+ mod1: Added TSconfig configuration for sidebar position: mod.web_txtemplavoilaM1.sideBarPosition
~ Manual: Updated TSconfig options and added screenshots for sidebar positions
~ !!! mod1: Changed TSconfig option tx_templavoila.mod1.createPageWizard.fieldNames to mod.web_txtemplavoilaM1.createPageWizard.fieldNames

2004-09-13  Robert Lemke  <robert@typo3.org>
+ mod1: Added two new modes for the sidebar, now you have "left", "toptabs" and "toprows". They will be configurable via TSconfig in the future, by now "toptabs" is default.
# mod1: Fixed a bug at the language selector which tried to select non-existing translations
+ mod1: Added flags next to the language selector which represent existing translations
# mod1: In the sidebar, changed menuItems array for the dynamic tab menu to num array

2004-09-09  Kasper Skaarhoej <kasperYYYY@typo3.com>

 * Fixed that color highlighting of data structure didn't show <meta> tag content.
 * Improved things in page module regarding sheets; Eg. counting elements on each sheet. Fixed some PHP5 array bugs also.
 * Totally removed that records in the page construction can be deleted - they are always unlinked when clicking the garbage-can (regardless of whether they are references or on current page).
 * Created bulletlist overview of DS and TO in Web>TemplaVoila module
 * Implemented support for sheet selection in pi1 (advanced feature). Fixed PHP5 bugs as well.
 * Implemented yet another fall-back mode for <langChildren>=1 ; The "removeIfBlank" mode which can unset elements totally if a field inside was not set.
 * Implemented visual feedback for FCE in frontend - this will give an overview of elements on the frontend page if the Admin Panel is expanded on the "Preview" tab and eg. "Show hidden pages" is enabled.

2004-09-08  Robert Lemke  <robert@typo3.org>

+ Added versioning sidebar item directly to the default sidebar instead of letting the version extension providing it.

2004-09-08  Robert Lemke  <robert@typo3.org>

~ Made everything DBAL compliant.
+ Added core version dependency to emconf.php (3.7.0.dev)
 * mod1: Added a dynamic sidebar and moved all meta information (like language selector, header fields etc.) into sidebar items.
~ mod1: (Sidebar) Modified the language selector: Now is a selectorbox instead of single links.
- mod1: Removed version selector. This will now be provided by the versioning extension itself by adding a new sidebar item.
~ mod1: Restructuring and cleanup of the whole module. Commented Kasper's new features. Externalized some methods into own classes, namely wizards and sidebar.
# mod1: Fixed the "show hidden" checkbox which worked just the other way around.
+ Manual: Added a reminder to write a section about sidebar programming
~ Updated ToDo
~ Changed my email address ;-)

2004-08-30  Robert Lemke  <robert@typo3.org>

  * Merged Kaspers and my changes.
  * cm2 Added a click menu item for showing on which pages the current content element is used in the pagetree. Bug: If other extensions add click menuitems to second level menus, they will appear here as well (needs core change, is on the ToDo)
  * mod3: Added a TemplaVoila tools module. Later on this should also contain wizard like converting from old-school to templavoila websites.
  * mod3: Added wizard for (re-) building indexing information about element reference (where which content element is used). You'll need to update table definitions in the extension manager.
  * ToDo for element references: Deleting CEs from elsewhere than the page module will not be registered automatically (see ToDo file)

2004-08-27  Kasper Skaarhoej  <kasperYYYY@typo3.com>

  * Page module: Added "Show hidden elements" box - can be moved to better position in page module
  * Corrected bugs for flagicons if they were not configured (they didn't display correctly of course).
  * Added fallback modes for "pi1" output. Updated manual with new rendering option for fall back modes.
  * Page module: Added "&L=xx" parameter to view-page icon (magnifying glass) so preview link to localized pages is correct.
  * Page module: Added overview of localized versions of other records. This is used when TypoScript is configured with "config.sys_language_overlay". Configurable.

2004-08-26  Kasper Skaarhoej  <kasperYYYY@typo3.com>

  * Changed the versioning selector...

2004-08-21  Kasper Skaarhoej  <kasperYYYY@typo3.com>

  * Finally added the "TemplaVoila" module to the Web main module and put some content into it! Now you can manage all your Data Structures and Template Objects from that module including creating new mappings and validate old ones.
  * Also added TAB menus to the TV page module
  * NOTICE: ALL changes here requires most recent 3.7.0-dev version from CVS in order to work!

2004-07-18  Robert Lemke  <robert@typo3.org>

 * Display and processing (copy, paste, insert etc.) for multi lang support now seems to be stable in the page module.

2004-07-18  Robert Lemke  <robert@typo3.org>

 * DS and TO records may now be sorted manually (in the backend). Make sure you update your .sql table definitions (in the extension manager).

2004-07-15  Robert Lemke  <robert@typo3.org>

 * Committed changes and development from the Paris sessions.
 * @Kasper: There only seemed to be one conflict in mod1/index.php which I could solve easily
 * @All the others: Be careful with this version, I didn't check if everything works. Wait until the next commit

2004-06-17  Robert Lemke  <robert@typo3.org>

 * Bugfix: headerfields, titlebarcolor etc. didn't work with inherited datastructures. Now they do.
 * New hook in pi1: renderElement_preProcessRow
 * Prepared some things about multi language support. Don't use it yet!
 * Guess what: Updated manual

2004-06-07  Robert Lemke  <robert@typo3.org>

	* Finished the Create New Page Wizard to an acceptable state ;-)
	* Created new Page TSconfig: createPageWizard.fieldNames
	* Other cool stuff. But I don't remember exactly ...
	* Updated manual (as usual)

2004-06-04  Robert Lemke  <robert@typo3.org>

	* Added new tag for data structures: <titleBarColor> (configures page module)
	* Updated manual

2004-06-03  Robert Lemke  <robert@typo3.org>

	* Re-implemented userfunctions in cm1 (eTypes, extra fields) to comply with the recommended way of providing hooks. I guess no other extension than mine has used that so far ...
	* Added hook in page module for inserting HTML code at the very top of the edit page screen - for providing a toolbar or sth. similar
	* Updated manual

2004-03-31  Kasper Skaarhoej  <kasperYYYY@typo3.com>

	* Fixed bug in htmlmarkup class where content were merged with template; When the number of "virtual records" exceeded a limit, none were merged.

2004-03-26  Robert Lemke  <robert@typo3.org>

	* Added icons, sponsored by Ben
	* Modified TSconfig userFunction properties for cm1 and updated manual

2004-03-24  Kasper Skaarhoej
	* Added a syntax highlight module for FlexForm data in tt_content and pages; access it as admin via the click menu of pages / tt_content elements.

2004-03-22  Robert Lemke  <robert@typo3.org>

	* Added two new TSconfig properties: mod.xMOD_tx_templavoila_cm1.eTypesExtraFormFieldsUserfunctions and mod.xMOD_tx_templavoila_cm1.eTypesConfGenUserfunctions

See the updated many for more information. BTW: Thanks for the extra fields!

2004-03-15  Robert Lemke  <robert@typo3.org>

	* Hey Kasper, you broke the create new page wizard ... ;-) Anyways, will find out what's wrong.
	* Small update for the manual (FAQ)

2004-03-09  Kasper Skaarhoej

	* Removed copy,cut,paste,new,delete links in Context Menu for content elements inside of TemplaVoila module; Doesn't do any good there since those features are specific for TemplaVoila and has to be managed in the module itself; Alternatively we should create menu items in the context menu which does the same as the buttons in the module, but that was too hard for me to think about tonight....
	* Added support for other root elements in backend module than pages. Setting another root element is done by the parameter set "&altRoot[table], &altRoot[uid], &altRoot[flex_field]"
	* Added clickmenu item for "TV children" in "content elements" -> a link to direct management of that element and subelements. Using the feature described above.
	* Fixed a few things with mapping, for instance that TypoScript Object Path can now be set in a little field - very convenient...

2003-12-22  Robert Lemke  <robert@typo3.org>

	* Nightly backup ...
	* started with create new content wizard

2003-12-21  Robert Lemke  <robert@typo3.org>

	* Daily backup ...
	* Mostly working on create new page wizard: Completed the creation of default elements with recursivity check.

2003-12-20  Robert Lemke  <robert@typo3.org>

	* Various additions, mostly rules + new page creation
	* Creates default content elements when creating a new page with the create new page wizard. Still things to do though.

2003-12-18  Robert Lemke  <robert@typo3.org>

	* Just an upload ...
	* Added new configuration for the EM: now you may specify the PID of the template folder (better idea than hardcode it to uid #2 ;-)
	* Browsetree gets updated, Page module (web_layout) is completely overridden: shortcut, edit page etc.
	* Various other things ...

2003-11-13  Robert Lemke  <robert@typo3.org>

	* Upload of current work status, no special milestone ...
	* Added support for all CTypes in new page module
	* Extended rules class, still not really working, but a at least a nice array is built
	* Continued developing the Create new page wizard, can create pages but selection of template missing still
	* Several changes here and there, comments added


2003-10-28  Kasper Skaarhoej

	* Added $Id: ChangeLog 47634 2011-05-12 14:08:36Z tolleiv $ keywords tags.
	* Added support+icon for iframe tags in htmlmarkup class.
	* Added package/subpackage tags.
