/*
 * WHAT IS IT:
 * This script is intended to provide administrator information and
 * relevant links to multiple Typo3 sites on a webserver.
 *
 * LOCATION:
 * This script must be located in a directory with the Typo3 source available in typo3_src/
 * The script includes the class t3lib/class.t3lib_superadmin.php
 *
 * IMPORTANT:
 * This script MUST be secured as it reads out password information an provides direct login links to sites!
 * It's recommended to use the script over a secure connection and to use the strongest webserver http-based authentication, you can.
 * Furthermore it's adviced to out-comment the 'die'-line below when you're not using the script.
 *
 * CONFIGURATION:
 * The point is that you configure one or more directories (parent directories) on the webserver to the script.
 * The script expects these directories (parents) to contain other directories (childs) exclusively with Typo3 sites in + any number of directories names 'typo3_src*' which will be ignored.
 * Every Typo3 site (child) in these parent directories will get listed in the interface.
 *
 * For each 'parent directory' you enter information like this:
 *
 * $parentDirs[] = array(
 * 	'dir'=> '/www/htdocs/typo3/32/',
 * 	'url' => 'http://192.168.1.4/typo3/32/'
 * );
 *
 * 'dir' is the absolute path of the parent directory where the sites are located in subdirs
 * 'url' is the web-accessible url of the parent directory.
